              Dear Mr Smith,<br><br>
                This letter is to express my interest in your internship program at which I am certain I can add to this company.
                I enjoy learning new things and very passionate about software development and I am very open to learning new languages and tools.<br><br> I believe this internship can provide me with valuable experience that can help me improve my skillset.
                I want to clarify a few things about my resume. I have learned android development for three months but I found that it did not align greatly with my goals, which is why I switched to a more computer science focused roadmap that uses web development as tool in learning the intricacies of computer science and problem solving.
                Thank you for your time and consideration<br><br>
                Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed. <br><br>
                In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.<br><br>
                Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and presentations on the conversation surrounding design over at discussingdesign.com.<br><br>

                Sincerely,<br>
                Yahia Ragae
